# HAGearS3
Home Assistant user interface for the Samsung Gear S3/S2 (tizen os)

# Instructions
In the interest of time I won't go into details on how to setup tizen sdk as there are plenty of guides out there. So aside from that if you have tizen ide setup you should be able to import this project after cloning it. Then just change the url and password in the js/services.js file (its hardcoded for now)

Thats it. Look out for an official release soon
